<p>I have my sqlite db in my assets folder.  The db is called foo.db   When I go to test my app, either on the emulator or my device, it always says no db present, created blank db.  My db is loaded with data and I want to have it push to the phone or emulator for testing.  Why does this not work?</p>

<p>Below is the section of my app that checks to see if the database is there... but it never finds it.  I have run it in debug mode and the DB_PATH  and DB_NAME have correct values, but still it creates an empty database each time.</p>

<p>What am I overlooking?</p>
