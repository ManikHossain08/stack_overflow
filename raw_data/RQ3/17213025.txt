<p>I am using this Rotate3dAnimation class to create a flipping coin animation which is also moving and scaling. But i can use it only with one image view. By just using startAnimation() method on that image view.</p>

<p>But What i want to do is, to use two sides of a coin so it will look like a real coin with two different sides is flipping. Can someone help me about how to do that?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
