<p>I am trying to read from a file and count how many times each string appears in the file. I am using a HashSet on the Object Item which i have created as follows :</p>

<p>Now in my main i am trying to read the file and add each String in the file to my set. Also while adding i am trying to increment the count of an item in the set which is appearing more than once. Here's my implementation for that :</p>

<pre><code>package pack;

public class Item {

    public String name;
    public int count=1;
    public Item(String name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        final int prime = 31;
        int result = 1;
        result = prime * result + count;
        result = prime * result + ((name == null) ? 0 : name.hashCode());
        return result;
    }
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj)
            return true;
        if (obj == null)
            return false;
        if (getClass() != obj.getClass())
            return false;
        Item other = (Item) obj;
        if (count != other.count)
            return false;
        if (name == null) {
            if (other.name != null)
                return false;
        } else if (!name.equals(other.name))
            return false;
        return true;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>For an input file like this : </p>

<p>chair table teapot<br>
teapot book table<br>
chair floor ceiling<br>
wall chair floor<br> </p>

<p>it is giving an output as follows :</p>

<p>wall appears 1 times<br>
book appears 1 times<br>
table appears 2 times<br>
floor appears 2 times<br>
teapot appears 2 times<br>
chair appears 1 times<br>
ceiling appears 1 times<br>
chair appears 2 times</p>

<p>Here the set is having duplicate elements which i don't want. What is the correct way to update the objects inside a set?</p>
