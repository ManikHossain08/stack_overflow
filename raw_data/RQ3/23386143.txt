<p>To run my code(my app) from Android Studio with AVD manager worked well. First I had a problem with the database not found there but then I used Monitor(DDMS) and just put the file in the right spot: /data/data/thePackagename/databases/database.sqlite</p>

<p><strong>My app works just fine and all Sqlite queries works just fine if the code just finds the database somewhere!</strong></p>

<p>Now I'm having problems with finding the actual database on a <strong>real phone(SGS4)</strong> where I have installed my app. 
Correct me if I'm wrong but: I guess I have to copy/move my database from some memory card on my SGS4 to this location: <strong>/data/data/thePackagename/databases/database.sqlite</strong> ...right?
Now how do I do that? Maybe I should just put the database in the internal or the external memory card then just copy it but I dont know how. I have followed some stackoverflow posts but I really dont know what I'm doing:)
Can I really get the database from the assets folder when running on a real UE? This copy trick did not even work with the AVD manager UE. I guess I need some professional help:)</p>

<p>I have used some of the code from here:
