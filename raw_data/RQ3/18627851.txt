<p>hi guys i have manged to animate an image by following the android flip animation tutorial, but I have this issue I am try to animate a butterfly like in the app <code>ibutterfly</code> and I am using this method to apply the transformation </p>

<pre><code>protected void applyTransformation(float interpolatedTime, Transformation t) {
    final float fromDegrees = mFromDegrees;
    float degrees = fromDegrees
            + ((mToDegrees - fromDegrees) * interpolatedTime);

    final float centerX = mCenterX;
    final float centerY = mCenterY;
    final Camera camera = mCamera;

    final Matrix matrix = t.getMatrix();

    camera.save();

    camera.rotateY(degrees);



    camera.getMatrix(matrix);
    camera.restore();

    matrix.preTranslate(-centerX, -centerY);
    matrix.postTranslate(centerX, centerY);

    matrix.preScale(scaleType.getScale(scale, interpolatedTime),
            scaleType.getScale(scale, interpolatedTime), centerX, centerY);

}
</code></pre>

<p>the problem I am having is the image rotate from the middle point but I need to change the rotate axis to left corner is there a way to do that, I tried everything I know but I cannot manage that, if some one can help me with this i will be much thankful </p>

<p>this is the tutorial i followed on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android-3d-flip-view-transition/" rel="nofollow">Google Code</a>.</p>
