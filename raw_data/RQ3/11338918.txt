<p>I have to do simple file operations code based,including copy/delete operations.The problem is if i declare the file location as a path</p>

<p><code>File remotefile = new File("//mypc/myfolder/myjar.JAR");</code></p>

<p>Windows finds the file in the network and does the operations.How ever Linux machines can not find the file.If i were to use:</p>

<p><code>File remotefile = new File("file://mypc/myfolder/myjar.JAR");</code> </p>

<p>Both platforms find the file.Now i have a method to copy the files which is:</p>

<pre><code>public static void copyFile(File sourceFile, File destFile) throws IOException {
    if(!destFile.exists()) {
        destFile.createNewFile();
    }

    FileChannel source = null;
    FileChannel destination = null;

    try {
        source = new FileInputStream(sourceFile).getChannel();
        destination = new FileOutputStream(destFile).getChannel();
        destination.transferFrom(source, 0, source.size());
    }
    finally {
        if(source != null) {
            source.close();
        }
        if(destination != null) {
            destination.close();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I were to send the file URI to this method, both platforms can not find the file. But if I send it as a path, windows machines work properly but linux machines can not find the file. </p>

<p>What could be the problem here?</p>
