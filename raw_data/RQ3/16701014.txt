<p>I'm finding that my CursorLoader callbacks are getting mixed up cursors.</p>

<p>The problem seems to be that </p>

<p>Fragment.getLoaderManager() is the same loader id scope as getActivity().getSupportLoaderManager()</p>

<p>from AOSP</p>

<pre><code>public LoaderManager getLoaderManager() {
    if (mLoaderManager != null) {
        return mLoaderManager;
    }
    if (mActivity == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Fragment " + this + " not attached to Activity");
    }
    mCheckedForLoaderManager = true;
    mLoaderManager = mActivity.getLoaderManager(mIndex, mLoadersStarted, true);
    return mLoaderManager;
}
</code></pre>

<p>so what I'm experiencing is ID conflict amongst my fragments, so the wrong cursors are hoping across fragments.</p>

<p>I need a strategy to create both static and/or dynamic(in the case of dynamic amounts of loaders) id's that are aware of every other fragments ids...?</p>
