<p>I have a SherlockFragmentActivity with two SherlockFragments in its tabs. Naturally I want to keep the currently selected tab active on orientation changes and when the user returns from an activity they've launched from either of the fragments.</p>

<p>So I use <em>onSaveInstanceState</em> to store the selected tab index and re-select it on <em>onCreate</em>. This works fine on orientation changes. But if I launch another activity (let's say a preferences screen) and return from it, the saved instance state is always null on <em>onCreate</em>, even though <em>onSaveInstanceState</em> has been called.  </p>

<p>So I guess the question is that am I just going at this the wrong way. If I use fragments am I forced to use only one activity with all the sub-screens as fragments?</p>

<p>Or is there some other reason why my saved instance state disappears between activity changes?</p>

<p>Edit: code from Activity B</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
    switch (item.getItemId()) {
        case android.R.id.home:
            Intent intent = new Intent(this, MainActivity.class);
            intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);
            startActivity(intent);
            return true;
        default:
            return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
    }
}
</code></pre>
