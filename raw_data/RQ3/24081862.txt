<p>I have many fragments in an activity. I move to some activity from one of the fragments. There are two cases. If I press hardware back button, I move back to the fragment from which current activity was called. But using action bar back button, previous activity is launched from onCreate state,like the very first fragment that I use when that activity is launched at first. Here is the code for action bar back button for second activity:
in onCreate: <code>getActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);</code>
then I use:</p>

<pre><code> @Override
        public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
            switch (item.getItemId()) {
            case android.R.id.home:
                NavUtils.navigateUpFromSameTask(this);
                return true;
            default:
                return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>How do I get the same function in action bar back button as in hardware bach button: onbackpressed??</p>
