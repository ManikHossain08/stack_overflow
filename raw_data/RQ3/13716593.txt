<p>I have a screen which uses ViewPager + actionbar Sherlock tabs. I have a <code>setOnPageChangeListener</code> set on the pager and it does the following:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onPageSelected(final int position) {
    actionBar.setSelectedNavigationItem(position);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works just fine in portrait mode and even in landscape if I only have few tabs and all the tabs are displayed. However if I add few more tabs in landscape, these collapse into a single drop-down widget. When I page through the ViewPager the <code>setSelectedNavigationItem</code> method is executed but now it has no effect on the drop-down selection: it stays at the last selected value. Which is really bad since user is missing a visual clue: tab may say "One" but user is already on page #6. </p>

<p>Is there a way to programmatically change which tab to display based on the position?</p>

<p>P.S. I know why this happens:
Here's code from com.android.internal.app.ActionBarImpl:</p>

<pre><code>public void setSelectedNavigationItem(int position) {
    switch (mActionView.getNavigationMode()) {
    case NAVIGATION_MODE_TABS:
        selectTab(mTabs.get(position));
        break;
    case NAVIGATION_MODE_LIST:
        mActionView.setDropdownSelectedPosition(position);
        break;
    default:
        throw new IllegalStateException(
                "setSelectedNavigationIndex not valid for current navigation mode");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And when I step through that I can see that the navigation mode is still NAVIGATION_MODE_TABS though tabs are displayed as list. Now - my knee jerk reaction is to put code into onConfigurationChanged to set navigation mode appropriately but shouldn't this happen automatically?</p>

<p>P.P.S. And there's <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=38500">Android bug</a> filed for it already that contains the patch</p>
