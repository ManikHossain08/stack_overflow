<p>I am writing an Android application that queries a databse with 170,000 dictionary words. (It has 31 coulumns: _id, word, sortedWord, ;ength, and count_A, count_B, count_C, ... count_Z)</p>

<p>And here is where I query the Dictionary in another class:</p>

<p>How can I query for wildcards given my current setup? I am new to sql, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated... I am looking for a parameter for the WHERE clause to allow for up to 2 wildcards, each of which could be anything from A-Z. </p>

<p>Here is an example of how i'm doing a lookup now, from my search service:</p>

<pre><code>DictionaryDbHelper helper = DictionaryDbHelper(this);
ArrayList<Result> matches = helper.getMatches(
                                this.getQuery().getCount_A(), this.getQuery().getCount_B(),
                                this.getQuery().getCount_C(), this.getQuery().getCount_D(),
                                this.getQuery().getCount_E(), this.getQuery().getCount_F(),
                                this.getQuery().getCount_G(), this.getQuery().getCount_H(),
                                this.getQuery().getCount_I(), this.getQuery().getCount_J(),
