<p>I try to draw lines between different GridPositions(x,y). Every GridPos has 4 Connections North, East, South, West. The Problem is if I paint a line from GridPos(1,1) to GridPos(2,2) the program will paint also a line in reverse direction between GridPos(2,2) and GridPos(1,1) later.</p>

<p>I tried to solve the problem with this class (WarpGate is the same as GridPos):</p>

<pre><code>public class GateConnection {

private WarpGate gate1 = null;
private WarpGate gate2 = null;

public GateConnection(WarpGate gate1, WarpGate gate2) {
    super();
    this.gate1 = gate1;
    this.gate2 = gate2;
}

@Override
public int hashCode() {
    final int prime = 31;

    int result = prime * ((gate1 == null) ? 0 : gate1.hashCode());
    result += prime * ((gate2 == null) ? 0 : gate2.hashCode());
    return result;
}

@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this == obj) {
        return true;
    }
    if (obj == null) {
        return false;
    }
    if (getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
        return false;
    }
    GateConnection other = (GateConnection) obj;
    if ((gate1.equals(other.gate1) || gate1.equals(other.gate2)) && (gate2.equals(other.gate2) || gate2.equals(other.gate1))) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>This Class could be added to an HashSet and the double painting would be gone but I don't know if the hashValue is always unique.</p>

<p>HashCode of WarpGate (auto-generated by eclipse):</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public int hashCode() {
    final int prime = 31;
    int result = 1;
    result = prime * result + gridX;
    result = prime * result + gridY;
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>For now I use an ArrayList. I look if the GateConnection exists, if not then add. But this version takes much more ressources than using a HashSet.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>The white rectangles are the connections which are painted, the numbers are the GridPositions(x|y) and the red Arrows are the two directions the rectangle is painted because GridPos(2|2) has a connection to GridPos(4|2) and (4|2) to (2|2)
