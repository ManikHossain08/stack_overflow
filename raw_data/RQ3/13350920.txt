<p>I'm working an existing SQLite database, I've looked at most tutorials for it, and I had it working for a brief time. Now I am receiving an error while I am copying the database. Long story short, the /data/data/(packageName)/databases is non-existent. I added the folder using the DDMS File Explorer on my emulator and it worked. What would cause the /databases folder to not be created?</p>

<pre><code>private void copyDataBase() throws IOException{
    InputStream myInput = dbContext.getAssets().open(DATABASE_NAME);
    String outFileName = DATABASE_PATH + DATABASE_NAME;
    OutputStream myOutput = new FileOutputStream(outFileName);
    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
    int length;
    while ((length = myInput.read(buffer))>0){
        myOutput.write(buffer, 0, length);
    }

    myOutput.flush();
    myOutput.close();
    myInput.close();
}
</code></pre>
